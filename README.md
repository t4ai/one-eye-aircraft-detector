# OneEye: Military Aircraft Detection with Computer Vision
# AAI-521-Final
Final project for AAI-521: Computer Vision, University of San Diego MS-AAI.

## Business Understanding (Hypothetical)
OneDefense, LLC is a defense contractor that provides high resolution satellite imagery with global coverage to the United States military and intelligence services.  The company has embarked on a strategy to provide AI-enrichment across its entire portfolio of imagery products in order to enable turnkey, high value use cases to customers.

With tensions rising in many theaters of operations, it has become difficult for human analysts to stay on top of key tasks, such as tracking the movement and readiness of military aircraft.  To help address this challenge, a key agency has requested OneDefense to develop a capability to monitor military airfields of key adversaries automatically using computer vision.  

Leveraging imagery collected on OneDefense satellite platforms, the application must meet the following objectives: 
Ingest and prepare satellite imagery for analysis 
Perform object detection and classification of key military aircraft located within these airfields.  
Provide counts of each aircraft type within the image frame

## Dataset

MAR20 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khlaifiabilel/military-aircraft-recognition-dataset/data) was used for transfer learning.  The selected dataset contained a total of 3,842 images labeled with 20 classes of aircraft types.  In total, 22,341 instances of aircraft were labeled (Military Aircraft Recognition Dataset, 2022)
